    <h1><u>History of Computers and the Internet</u></h1>
    <blockquote> The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before. </blockquote>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The earliest computing devices were <i>mechanical calculators</i> like the <strong>abacus</strong> and Charles Babbage’s <ins>Analytical Engine</ins>. These machines laid the foundation for modern computing. In the 1940s, the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> emerged as a core component of electronic computers. <del>Punch cards</del> were once used for input, but were later replaced by more efficient methods. The <b>ENIAC</b> was one of the first general-purpose computers, using thousands of vacuum tubes. <mark>Alan Turing</mark>’s work on computation theory was pivotal. As <cite>Isaac Asimov</cite> once noted, <q>Science can amuse and fascinate us all, but it is engineering that changes the world.</q>

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet began as <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr> in the late 1960s. It connected universities and research centers. The introduction of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> revolutionized web content. Tim Berners-Lee invented the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>, enabling users to access documents via hyperlinks. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in HTML allows linking between pages. <em>Email</em> became a primary communication tool. The protocol <code>TCP/IP</code> standardized data transmission. As <blockquote>Steve Jobs once said, “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”</blockquote>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        Today’s computers are <b>faster</b>, <i>smarter</i>, and more <u>connected</u> than ever. Cloud computing, AI, and IoT dominate the tech landscape. Devices now use <code>machine learning</code> to adapt and improve. Smartphones are essentially powerful computers in your pocket. The formula for calculating resistance, <var>R</var> = <var>V</var>/<var>I</var>, is still relevant in hardware design. <sup>5</sup>G networks have accelerated data speeds. <samp>404 Error</samp> is a common message when a page is not found. Developers use <kbd>Git</kbd> and <kbd>VS Code</kbd> for version control and coding. <del>Floppy disks</del> are obsolete, replaced by <ins>SSDs and cloud storage</ins>.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        Computers evolved through <strong>five generations</strong>. The first used vacuum tubes; the second introduced <abbr title="Transistors">transistors</abbr>. The third generation saw <em>integrated circuits</em>, while the fourth brought <b>microprocessors</b>. The fifth generation focuses on <mark>artificial intelligence</mark>. Each leap improved speed, size, and efficiency. For example, the formula <var>E</var> = <var>mc</var><sup>2</sup> symbolizes the power of energy transformation, much like computing power evolved. <small>Note: Moore’s Law predicted that transistor counts would double every two years.</small> The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd> command became iconic in rebooting systems.

    <h2>Code Example</h2>

    <hr>

    <pre><code>
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
int main()
{
    for (int i=1; i&lt=5 ; i++){
        printf("%d",i);
    }
    return 0;
}
    </code></pre>
