        <h1>Section 1</h1>
        <p>  I started for school very late that morning and was in great dread 
of a scolding, especially because M. Hamel had said that he would 
question us on participles, and I did not know the first word about 
them. For a moment I thought of running away and spending the 
day out of doors. It was so warm, so bright! The birds were chirping 
at the edge of the woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill 
the Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more tempting 
than the rule for participles, but I had the strength to resist, and 
hurried off to school.  </p>

        <p> Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle, which 
could be heard out in the street, the opening and closing of desks, 
lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with our hands over our ears 
to understand better, and the teacher’s great ruler rapping on the 
table. But now it was all so still! I had counted on the commotion 
to get to my desk without being seen; but, of course, that day 
everything had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the 
window I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel 
walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his arm. I 
had to open the door and go in before everybody. You can imagine 
how I blushed and how frightened I was. </p>

        <p> My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to write! I should 
never learn any more! I must stop there, then! Oh, how sorry I was 
for not learning my lessons, for seeking birds’ eggs, or going sliding 
on the Saar! My books, that had seemed such a nuisance a while ago, 
so heavy to carry, my grammar, and my history of the saints, were 
old friends now that I couldn’t give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea 
that he was going away, that I should never see him again, made me 
forget all about his ruler and how cranky he was.</p>

        <p>I heard M. Hamel say to me, “I won’t scold you, little Franz; 
you must feel bad enough. See how it is! Every day we have said to 
ourselves, ‘Bah! I’ve plenty of time. I’ll learn it tomorrow.’ And now 
you see where we’ve come out. Ah, that’s the great trouble with 
Alsace; she puts off learning till tomorrow. Now those fellows out 
there will have the right to say to you, ‘How is it; you pretend to 
be Frenchmen, and yet you can neither speak nor write your own 
language?’ But you are not the worst, poor little Franz. We’ve all a 
great deal to reproach ourselves with.”</p>
