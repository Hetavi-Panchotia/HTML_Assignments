    <!-- <p>Whenever I looked up from my writing I saw M. Hamel sitting 
motionless in his chair and gazing first at one thing, then at another, 
as if he wanted to fix in his mind just how everything looked in that 
little school-room. Fancy! For forty years he had been there in the 
same place, with his garden outside the window and his class in 
front of him, just like that. Only the desks and benches had been 
worn smooth; the walnut-trees in the garden were taller, and the 
hopvine that he had planted himself twined about the windows to 
the roof. How it must have broken his heart to leave it all, poor 
man; to hear his sister moving about in the room above, packing 
their trunks! For they must leave the country next day.</p>

<p>While I was thinking of all this, I heard my name called. It was 
my turn to recite. What would I not have given to be able to say 
that dreadful rule for the participle all through, very loud and clear, 
and without one mistake? But I got mixed up on the first words 
and stood there, holding on to my desk, my heart beating, and not 
daring to look up. 
I heard M. Hamel say to me, “I won’t scold you, little Franz; 
you must feel bad enough. See how it is! Every day we have said to 
ourselves, ‘Bah! I’ve plenty of time. I’ll learn it tomorrow.’ And now 
you see where we’ve come out. Ah, that’s the great trouble with 
Alsace; she puts off learning till tomorrow. Now those fellows out 
there will have the right to say to you, ‘How is it; you pretend to 
be Frenchmen, and yet you can neither speak nor write your own 
language?’ But you are not the worst, poor little Franz. We’ve all a 
great deal to reproach ourselves with.”</p>
<p>strange and solemn. But the thing 
that surprised me most was to see, 
on the back benches that were 
always empty, the village people 
sitting quietly like ourselves; old 
Hauser, with his three-cornered 
hat, the former mayor, the former 
postmaster, and several others 
besides. Everybody looked sad; and 
Hauser had brought an old primer, 
thumbed at the edges, and he held 
it open on his knees with his great 
spectacles lying across the pages.
 While I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted his 
chair, and, in the same grave and gentle tone which he had used to 
me, said, “My children, this is the last lesson I shall give you. The 
order has come from Berlin to teach only German in the schools of 
Alsace and Lorraine. The new master comes tomorrow. This is your 
last French lesson. I want you to be very attentive.”
 What a thunderclap these words were to me!
 Oh, the wretches; that was what they had put up at the  
town-hall!
 My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to write! I should 
never learn any more! I must stop there, then! Oh, how sorry I was 
for not learning my lessons, for seeking birds’ eggs, or going sliding 
on the Saar! My books, that had seemed such a nuisance a while ago, 
so heavy to carry, my grammar, and my history of the saints, were 
old friends now that I couldn’t give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea 
that he was going away, that I should never see him again, made me 
forget all about his ruler and how cranky he was.
 Poor man! It was in honour of this last lesson that he had 
put on his fine Sunday clothes, and now I understood why the 
old men of the village were sitting there in the back of the room. It 
was because they were sorry, too, that they had not gone to school 
more. It was their way of thanking our master for his forty years 
of faithful service and of showing their respect for the country that 
was theirs no more.
